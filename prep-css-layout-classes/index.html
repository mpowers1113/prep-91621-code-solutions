        <h3>Last Crusade</h3>
        <p>Tommy Callahan Jr. is a slow-witted, clumsy guy who recently graduated college after attending for seven
          years. His father, Big Tom Callahan, owns an auto parts factory in Ohio. When Tommy arrives back home, he
          finds he has a position at the factory waiting for him. His dad also introduces Tommy to the new brake pad
          division of the factory and to Tommy's soon-to-be stepmother, Beverly, and her son Paul. But when Big Tom
          dies, the factory threatens to go under unless the new brake pads are to be sold. Therefore, Tommy must go on
          the road to sell them, along with the assistance of Richard, Big Tom's right-hand man. Will Tommy save the
          company, or will the factory, and the town, go under?</p>
